Hi guys! As soon as we need to exchange some information between us, I'm posting the questions that we need to answer to here. So we will be able to do our homeworks.

1. What is your name?

2. Where are you from?

3. What hobbies/pastimes do you enjoy?

4. Why did you pick SoftUni?


1. Alek Hristov
2. I'm from Sofia, Bulgaria
3. I enjoy watching football, drinking rakia and having walks outdoors
4. I picked Softuni cause my best friends pushed me to. Now I'm really happy with my choice, cause I enjoy studying computer programming very much.
